TU configs for stockalike mods

TU configs and textures for stockalike mods, release version includes shiny BDB Atlas-Agena for now. If BDBNIC is installed then those colour options will be incorporated. Plan is to incorporate these into TU recolours like the Atlas.

BDB Atlas - Fully recolourable livveries (and engines) and custom metallic gloss maps

BDB Agena - Metallic gloss maps

BDB Titan - Basic* Metallic gloss maps, going to need some proper texturing to get the patchwork look of the Titan right.

BDB SAF Fairings - as the base launch vehicle gets textures so do the corresponding fairings

BDB Engines - Thor, Able and Centaur engines have basic metallic gloss maps

Long term plans are textures and configs for restockalike parts that really need it - engines, steel tanks etc.

Base textures for the Atlas are from BDBNIC and Bluedog_DB.
Base textures for the Agena are from Bluedog_DB.

*Basic metallic gloss maps are derivatives of the original spec map. Still miles better than an indiscriminate model config*
