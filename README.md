TU configs for BDB
TU configs and textures for stockalike mods, release version includes shiny BDB Atlas-Agena for now. Downloading the git includes the Titan and Centaur. If BDBNIC is installed then those colour options will be incorporated. Plan is to incorporate these into TU recolours like the Atlas.


BDB Atlas - Fully recolourable liveries (and engines) and custom metallic gloss maps

BDB Agena - Metallic gloss maps

BDB Titan - Basic* metallic gloss maps, going to need some proper texturing to get the patchwork look of the Titan right.

BDB Centaur - Basic metallic gloss maps

BDB SAF Fairings - as the base launch vehicle gets textures so do the corresponding fairings

BDB Engines - Thor and Able engines have basic metallic gloss maps


Long term plans are textures and configs for restockalike parts that really need it - engines, steel tanks etc.

Base textures for the Atlas are from BDBNIC and Bluedog Design Bureau

Base textures for the Agena are from Bluedog Design Bureau

**Basic metallic gloss maps are derivatives of the original spec map. Still miles better than an indiscriminate model config*
