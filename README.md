# Barking Owl Bureau

TU configs for BDB. If BDBNIC is installed then those colour options will be incorporated. Plan is to incorporate these into TU recolours like the Atlas.

What's currently included:

BDB Atlas - Fully recolourable liveries (and engines) and bespoke metallic gloss maps

BDB Agena - Bespoke etallic gloss maps

BDB Titan - Basic* metallic gloss maps

BDB Centaur - Basic metallic gloss maps

BDB SAF Fairings - as the base launch vehicle gets textures so do the corresponding fairings

BDB Engines - Thor and Able engines have basic metallic gloss maps


**Basic metallic gloss maps contain a roughness and metallicity texture derived from the spec texture, a tiny step up from deferred*
