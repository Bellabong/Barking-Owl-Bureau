PBR Textures and TU/B9PS configs for BDB. Mod is designed around SSAO (Screenspace Ambient Occlusion) of post-processing add-ons being on. 

Please note that most publically available TUFX/K3SP profiles have too much bloom in their settings for PBR. Testing was done with blackracks TUFX profile with bloom tuned off.


What's currently included:

BDB Atlas - Fully recolourable liveries (and engines) and bespoke metallic/smoothness maps

BDB Agena - Bespoke metallic/smoothness gloss maps and recolourable AgenaD

BDB Titan - Basic* metallic/smoothness maps, recolourable liveries with a usability update for BDB 13.x

BDB Centaur - Basic metallic/smoothness maps

BDB SAF Fairings - as the base launch vehicle gets textures so do the corresponding fairings

BDB Engines - Thor and Able engines have basic metallic gloss maps


**Basic metallic gloss maps contain a smoothness and metallicity texture derived from the spec texture, a tiny step up from deferred*
